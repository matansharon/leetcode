# Our hero Teemo is attacking an enemy Ashe with poison attacks! When Teemo attacks Ashe, Ashe gets poisoned for a exactly duration seconds. More formally, an attack at second t will mean Ashe is poisoned during the inclusive time interval [t, t + duration - 1]. If Teemo attacks again before the poison effect ends, the timer for it is reset, and the poison effect will end duration seconds after the new attack.

# You are given a non-decreasing integer array timeSeries, where timeSeries[i] denotes that Teemo attacks Ashe at second timeSeries[i], and an integer duration.

# Return the total number of seconds that Ashe is poisoned.

 

# Example 1:

# Input: timeSeries = [1,4], duration = 2
# Output: 4
# Explanation: Teemo's attacks on Ashe go as follows:
# - At second 1, Teemo attacks, and Ashe is poisoned for seconds 1 and 2.
# - At second 4, Teemo attacks, and Ashe is poisoned for seconds 4 and 5.
# Ashe is poisoned for seconds 1, 2, 4, and 5, which is 4 seconds in total.
# Example 2:

# Input: timeSeries = [1,2], duration = 2
# Output: 3
# Explanation: Teemo's attacks on Ashe go as follows:
# - At second 1, Teemo attacks, and Ashe is poisoned for seconds 1 and 2.
# - At second 2 however, Teemo attacks again and resets the poison timer. Ashe is poisoned for seconds 2 and 3.
# Ashe is poisoned for seconds 1, 2, and 3, which is 3 seconds in total.
